            <h2>Akihiko Yamashita’s Anime Journey</h2>
            <p>Akihiko Yamashita, who’s worked on titles as wide reaching as The Big O and Evangelion 2.0, has quite the anime resume. Since 2001, he’s been working with Studio Ghibli, having done work on Spirited Away all the way through The Boy and the Heron.</p>

            <p>Yamashita’s foray into anime came a bit slowly
                “As a child, I watched various animations without really being aware that this was this incredible medium,” Yamashita told Polygon via a translator. That all changed when he was in junior high school. “I happened to see The Castle of Cagliostro, and that was the one that really made me aware that you could really have a fantastically beautiful and excellent film.”
                It was, “by coincidence” directed by Hayao Miyazaki, whom Yamashita went on to work with closely, starting with a more direct relationship on Howl’s Moving Castle. To say this job was a dream come true for him would be putting it mildly. The Castle of Cagliostro was the catalyst for him seeing all that animation could be.
                “I thought: This shows that animation can be really fun,” Yamashita says. “And then even with simple lines we could express so much in terms of how to show movement, how to show animation.”
                Yamashita credits the movie’s many car chases in the film with catching his eye — with a little special love for the film’s beginning one. “That really amped up my voltage [...] when I saw the car chase, I thought that was just amazing that that could be done by such simple animation.”</p>

            <p>Which makes sense. It’s hard to remember a time when Miyazaki was simply another artist in line to make the leap from working for an animation studio to directing (by taking on the third film spun off from a popular anime). But The Castle of Cagliostro is exactly that; Miyazaki honing his skills by painting with someone else’s palette. Miyazaki took liberties with the character — changing from the traditional ruthless type modeled after Arsène Lupin to a goofball who seems to be all limbs and luck. This Lupin’s life is far from glamorous, seemingly based out of the modest yellow Fiat and mawkishly coming onto the waitress.</p>
